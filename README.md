# Snake Game

In this project, I have developed the popular Snake game using Python. 

The project consists of 4 Python files:
  - main.py: Run this to start the game
  - snake.py
  - scoreboard.py
  - food.py

In addition, the project has one text file:
  - data.txt: keeps track of the high score. Initially, I have set it to 10

## Below is a Demo of the game
